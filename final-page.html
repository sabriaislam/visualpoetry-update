			<div>Feeling</div>
			<div>I am rising</div>
			<div>I imagine them pouring vodka all over each other wearing glitter.</div>
			<div>I have carried you in my old notebooks</div>
			<div>As the fire of my verses</div>

			<div>The shops in the village are leaking bodies.</div>
			<div>glorious bullshit.</div>
			<div>I was never meant to last.</div>
			<div>For what is evil but good tortured by its own hunger and thirst?</div>

			<div>as the best part of the song.</div>
			<div>a thorn in my heart</div>
			<div>words were a song</div>
			<div>You are good when you are fully awake in your speech,</div>
		</div>
		<div class = "last-5">
			<div>mirrors were shattered,</div>
			<div>Was it your departure that rushed the lyre or was it my silence?</div>
			<div>I love oranges and hate the port</div>
			<div>Only the orange peel is ours, and behind me lay the desert.</div>
		</div>
		<div class="last-6">
			<div>You are the other lung in my chest;</div>
			<div>You are the sound on my lips;</div>
			<div>In your longing for your giant self lies your goodness: and that longing is in all of you.</div>
