			<div class ="darwish-title">A Lover from Palestine</div><br>
			<div>Your eyes are <a class="feelings">a thorn in my heart</a></div>
			<div>Inflicting pain, <a class="feelings">yet I cherish that thorn</a></div>
			<div>And shield it from the wind.</div>
			<div>I sheathe it in my flesh, I sheathe it, protecting it from night and agony,</div>
			<div>And its wound lights the lanterns,</div>
			<div>Its tomorrow makes my present</div>
			<div>Dearer to me than my soul.</div>
			<div>And soon I forget, as eye meets eye,</div>
			<div>That once, behind the doors, there were two of us.</div><br>
			<div>Your <a class="feelings">words were a song</a></div>
			<div>And I tried to sing, too,</div>
			<div>But agony encircled the lips of spring.</div>
			<div>And like the swallow, your words took wing,</div>
			<div>The door of our home and the autumnal threshold migrated,</div>
			<div>To follow you wherever led by longing</div>
			<div>Our <a class="feelings">mirrors were shattered,</a></div>
			<div>And sorrow was multiplied a thousand fold.</div>
			<div>And we gathered the splinters of sound,</div>
			<div>Mastering only the elegy of our homeland!</div>
			<div>Together were will plant it in the heart of a lyre,</div>
			<div>And on the rooftops of our tragedy we'll play it</div>
			<div>To mutilated moons and to stones.</div>
			<div>But I have forgotten, you of the unknown voice:</div>
			<div><a class="important-quotes">Was it your departure that rushed the lyre or was it my silence?</a></div><br>
			<div>Yesterday I saw you in the port,</div>
			<div>A long voyager without provisions,</div>
			<div>Like an orphan I ran to you,</div>
			<div>Asking the wisdom of our forefathers:</div>
			<div>How can the ever-verdant orange grove be dragged</div>
			<div>To prison, to exile, to a port,</div>
			<div>And despite all her travels,</div>
			<div>Despite the scent of salt and longing,</div>
			<div>Remain evergreen?</div>
			<div>I write in my diary:</div>
			<div><a class="feelings">I love oranges and hate the port</a></div>
			<div>And I write further:</div>
			<div>On the dock</div>
			<div>I stood, and saw the world through Witter's eyes</div>
			<div><a class="feelings">Only the orange peel is ours, and behind me lay the desert.</a></div><br>
			<div>In the briar-covered mountains I saw you,</div>
			<div>A shepherdess without sheep,</div>
			<div>Pursued among the ruins.</div>
			<div><a class="important-quotes">You were my garden, and I a stranger,</a></div>
			<div>Knocking at the door, my heart,</div>
			<div>For upon my heart stand firm</div>
			<div>The door and windows, the cement and stones.</div><br>
			<div>I have seen you in casks of water, in granaries,</div>
			<div>Broken, I have seen you a maid in night clubs,</div>
			<div>I have seen you in the gleam of tears and in wounds.</div>
			<div><a class="feelings">You are the other lung in my chest;</a></div>
			<div><a class="feelings">You are the sound on my lips;</a></div>
			<div>You are water; you are fire.</div><br>
			<div>I saw you at the mouth of the cave, at the cavern,</div>
			<div>Hanging your orphans' rags on the wash line.</div>
			<div>In the stoves, in the streets I have seen you.</div>
			<div>In the barns and in the sun's blood.</div>
			<div>In the songs of the orphaned and the wretched I have seen you.</div>
			<div>I have seen you in the salt of the sea and in the sand.</div>
			<div>Yours was the beauty of the earth, of children and of Arabian jasmine.</div>
		</div>
		<div class = "darwish-poem-right">
			<div>And I have vowed</div>
			<div>To fashion from my eyelashes a kerchief,</div>
			<div>And upon it to embroider verses for your eyes,</div>
			<div>And a name, when watered by a heart that dissolves in chanting,</div>
			<div>Will make the sylvan arbours grow.</div>
			<div>I shall write a phrase more precious than honey and kisses:</div>
			<div>'Palestinian she was and still is'.</div><br>
			<div>On a night of storms, I opened the door and the window</div>
			<div>To see the hardened moon of our nights.</div>
			<div>I said to the night: Run out,</div>
			<div>Beyond the <a class="text" href="khalil.html"><u>darkness</u></a> and the wall;</div>
			<div>I have a promise to keep with words and light.</div>
			<div>You are my virgin garden</div>
			<div>As long as our songs</div>
			<div>Are swords when we draw them.</div>
			<div>And you are as faithful as grain</div>
			<div>So long as our songs</div>
			<div>Keep alive the fertile soil when we plant them.</div>
			<div>You are like a palm tree in the mind:</div>
			<div>Neither storm nor woodsman's ax can fell it.</div>
			<div>Its braids uncut</div>
			<div>By the beasts of desert and forest</div>
			<div>But I am the exiled one behind wall and door,</div>
			<div>Shelter me in the warmth of your gaze.</div><br>
			<div>Take me, wherever you are,</div>
			<div>Take me, however you are.</div>
			<div>To be restored to the warmth of face and body,</div>
			<div>To the light of heart and eye,</div>
			<div>To the salt of bread and song,</div>
			<div>To the taste of earth and homeland.</div>
			<div>Shelter me in the warmth of your gaze,</div>
			<div>Take me, a panel of almond wood, in the cottage of sorrows,</div>
			<div>Take me, a verse from the book of my tragedy,</div>
			<div>Take me, a plaything or a stone from the house,</div>
			<div>So that our next generation may recall</div>
			<div>The path of return to our home.</div><br>
			<div>Her eyes and the tattoo on her hands are Palestinian,</div>
			<div><a class="feelings">Her name, Palestinian,</a></div>
			<div><a class="feelings">Her dreams, and sorrow, Palestinian,</a></div>
			<div><a class="feelings">Her Kerchief, her feet and body, Palestinian,</a></div>
			<div><a class="feelings">Her words and her silence, Palestinian,</div>
			<div><a class="feelings">Her voice, Palestinian,</a></div>
			<div><a class="feelings">Her birth and her death, Palestinian,</a></div>
			<div><a class="important-quotes">I have carried you in my old notebooks</a></div>
			<div><a class="important-quotes">As the fire of my verses,</a></div>
			<div>The sustenance for my journeys.</div>
			<div>In your name, my voice rang in the valleys:</div>
			<div>I have seen Byzantium's horses</div>
			<div>Even though the battle be different.</div>
			<div>Beware, oh beware</div>
			<div>The lightning struck by my song in the granite.</div>
			<div>I am the flower of youth and the knight of knights!</div>
			<div>I am the smasher of idols.</div>
			<div>I plant the Levantine borders</div>
			<div>With poems that set eagles free.</div>
			<div>And in your name I have shouted at the enemy:</div>
			<div>Worms, feed on my flesh if ever I slumber,</div>
			<div>For the eggs of ants cannot hatch eagles,</div>
			<div>And the shell of the adder's egg</div>
			<div>Holds but a snake!</div>
			<div>I have seen Byzantium's horses,</div>
			<div>And before it all, I know</div>
			<div>That I am the flower of youth and the knight of knights!</div>
