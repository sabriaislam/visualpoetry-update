		<div>On Good and Evil</div>
	</div>
	<div class = "stanza-1">
		<div>And one of the elders of the city said, Speak to us of Good and Evil.</div>
		<div>And he answered:</div>
		<div>Of the good in you I can speak, but not of the evil.</div>
		<div><a class="important-quotes">For what is evil but good tortured by its own hunger and thirst?</a></div>
		<div>Verily when good is hungry it seeks food even in dark caves, and when it thirsts it drinks even of dead waters.</div>
	</div>
	<div class = "stanza-2">
		<div>You are good when you are one with yourself.</div>
		<div>Yet when you are not one with yourself you are not evil.</div>
		<div>For a divided house is not a den of thieves; it is only a divided house.</div>
		<div>And a ship without rudder may wander aimlessly among perilous isles yet sink not to the bottom.</div>
	</div>
	<div class = "stanza-3">
		<div>You are good when you strive to give of yourself.</div>
		<div>Yet you are not evil when you seek gain for yourself.</div>
		<div>For when you strive for gain you are but a root that clings to the earth and sucks at her breast.</div>
		<div>Surely the fruit cannot say to the root, “Be like me, ripe and full and ever giving of your abundance.”</div>
		<div>For to the fruit giving is a need, as receiving is a need to the root.</div>
	</div>
	<div class="stanza-4">
		<div><a class="important-quotes">You are good when you are fully awake in your speech,</a></div>
		<div><a class="important-quotes">Yet you are not evil when you sleep while your tongue staggers without purpose.</a></div>
		<div>And even stumbling speech may strengthen a weak tongue.</div>
	</div>
	<div class = "stanza-5">
		<div>You are good when you walk to your goal firmly and with bold steps.</div>
		<div>Yet you are not evil when you go thither limping.</div>
		<div>Even those who limp go not backward.</div>
		<div>But you who are strong and swift, see that you do not limp before the lame, deeming it kindness.</div>
		<div></div>
		<div>You are good in countless ways, and you are not evil when you are not good,</div>
		<div>You are only loitering and sluggard.</div>
		<div>Pity that the stags cannot teach swiftness to the turtles.</div>
	</div>
	<div class = "stanza-6">
		<div><a class="important-quotes">In your longing for your giant self lies your goodness: and that longing is in all of you.</a></div>
	</div>
	<div = class = "stanza-7">
		<div>But in some of you that longing is a torrent rushing with might to the sea, carrying the secrets of the hillsides and the songs of the forest.</div>
	</div>
	<div class = "stanza-8">
		<div>And in others it is a flat stream that loses itself in angles and bends and lingers before it reaches the shore.</div>
	</div>
	<div class = "stanza-9">
		<div>But let not him who longs much say to him who longs little, “Wherefore are you slow and halting?”</div>
	</div>
	<div class="stanza-10">
		<div>For the truly good ask not the naked, “Where is your garment?” nor the houseless, “What has befallen your house?”</div>
